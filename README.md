# Introduction  
### **Nothing is worse than dying on a competitive server while being AFK.** [[Focused]](https://modrinth.com/mod/focusedminecraft/) **prevents that.**

## How?  
**Whenever you're being attacked, the game unminimizes and refocuses itself so you can jump straight into action!**

## Version Support?  
Currently, only **1.21.5 is supported.**  
Iâ€™m planning to add support for **1.21+** soon.
